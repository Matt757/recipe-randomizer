# recipe-randomizer
An application that gives you a random recipe that you have not cooked in a while based on some factors

This application aims to help you when you do not know what to cook by giving you a random recipe with some filters that you set and that has not been cooked in a while.

The main page is currently composed of 3 blocks that serve different purposes

The table shows all of the saved recipes and some info about them, such as notes, the last time it was cooked, if it requires a side dish and so on

By clicking on a recipe, a menu is opened on the right side which allows editing, deleting, or updating the last cooked date to the current day
