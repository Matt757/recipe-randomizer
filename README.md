# recipe-randomizer
An application that gives you a random recipe that you have not cooked in a while based on some factors

This application aims to help you when you do not know what to cook by giving you a random recipe with some filters that you set and that has not been cooked in a while.

The newest version begins with the main page which displays 3 buttons that redirect to 3 different pages.

The first page is the page that gives us a random recipe based on the two filters. The first filter is for choosing a meal in the case of a fast day, and the second filter allows you to choose if you want to cook a meal only for a day or maybe you want a bigger recipe that can cover multiple days.

The "Add first course" button allows you to add a random first course dish to your meal. By clicking it again after recieveing a first course, you will get a random different one. The "I will cook this today" button updates the last cooked date to the current date.

The second page is the page that gives us all of the main dishes that we have.
